## Description
Hey there! Welcome to my inventory management system project! This is a full stack web app that I built using a combination of Node.js, Rust, MongoDB, Jsonwebtoken, Tailwindcss, Daisyui, and Web Assembly.

With this system, you'll be able to easily manage your inventory, keep track of your stock levels, and get real-time updates on your sales and purchases. Plus, it's super user-friendly and easy to navigate, so you won't have to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out how to use it.

I had a blast putting this project together, and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it. So go ahead and give it a try! And if you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Tailwindcss
- DaisyUI
- Rustlang
- Web Assembly
- Mongodb
- JsonWebToken

## Inspiration
Hey there! So, you might be wondering what inspired me to build this inventory management system project. Well, the truth is, I've always had a curious nature, and I love tinkering around with new technologies and exploring what they can do.

That's what led me to Rust and Web Assembly, two incredibly powerful tools that are changing the way we build web apps. With Rust's blazing-fast speed and memory safety, and Web Assembly's ability to run high-performance code in the browser, I knew that I could create something truly special.

But that wasn't enough for me - I wanted to take it even further. So, I decided to combine Rust and Web Assembly with some other cutting-edge technologies, like Node.js, MongoDB, Jsonwebtoken, Tailwindcss, and Daisyui. The result? A full-stack inventory management system that is lightning-fast, secure, and easy to use.

I'm really proud of what I've been able to create with this project, and I hope that it inspires others to explore the possibilities of Rust, Web Assembly, and other emerging technologies. After all, who knows what amazing things we can create when we let our curiosity and creativity run wild!

## Some project-related FAQs

### What technologies did you use to build this project?
This project was built using a combination of Node.js, Rust, MongoDB, Jsonwebtoken, Tailwindcss, Daisyui, and Web Assembly. Each of these technologies was chosen for its unique strengths and capabilities, and together they form a powerful stack that is both fast and user-friendly.

### Why did you choose to use Rust and Web Assembly for this project?
Rust and Web Assembly are two cutting-edge technologies that are changing the way we build web apps. Rust is known for its blazing-fast speed and memory safety, while Web Assembly enables high-performance code to run in the browser. By combining these two technologies, we were able to create an inventory management system that is lightning-fast and secure.

### How does the system handle inventory tracking and management?
The system is designed to handle all aspects of inventory tracking and management, including stock levels, purchases, and sales. Users can easily add and remove products from their inventory, set stock levels and reorder points, and track sales and purchase orders in real-time.

### Is the system secure?
Yes, the system is designed with security in mind at every step. User authentication and authorization is handled using Jsonwebtoken, which provides industry-standard encryption and secure token-based authentication. Additionally, the system is built with Rust and Web Assembly, both of which are known for their strong security features.

### How can I get started with using the system?
To get started, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README.md file. The system requires Node.js, Rust, and MongoDB to run, so be sure to have those installed before you begin. Once you have the system up and running, you can start managing your inventory right away!

## Future scope

- Addition of sales-related predictions on dashboard, aided by ML algorithms, implemented from scratch using Rustlang & Mongodb.
- Server-side rendering for web assembly frontend.
